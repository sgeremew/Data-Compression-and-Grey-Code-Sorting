# Data-Compression-and-Grey-Code-Sorting

In the program.py file there are three algorithms implemented which come from the scholarly article 
written by Dana Richards, my CS 483 Algorithms professor. All three algorithms have the same goal 
which is to take a file and compress the data by using Grey Code Sorting. The 3 implemented algorithms take 
other algorithms like Ernval's algorithm, Horner's rule, and Radix sorting and generalize them 
to the grey ordering that we need. We are generalizing to mixed radix grey order sorting algorithms.
